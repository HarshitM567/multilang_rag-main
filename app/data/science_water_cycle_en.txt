Title: The Water Cycle
The water cycle has four main stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.
Evaporation occurs when the sun heats up water, turning it into vapor.
Condensation happens when water vapor cools and forms clouds.
Precipitation is when water falls from clouds as rain, snow, or hail.
Collection is when water gathers in rivers, lakes, and oceans.
